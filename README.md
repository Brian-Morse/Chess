# Chess
 
This is my implementation of chess utilizing Python and Pygame. Click the pieces and the game will display where you can move the chess piece, click one of the squares to move it. Play until there is either a checkmate or stalemate

*Some special buttons to affect the game*

- Press **R** to reset the game
- Press **U** to undo a move
- Press **F** to lock or unlock the screen flipping for turn perspective
